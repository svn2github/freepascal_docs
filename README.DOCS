This is the README for the Free Pascal documentation.

All documentation is stored here, in LaTeX format and in fpdoc format.
it uses special style files (fpc*.sty) which are also in the directory.

do a 'make dvi' to produce the dvi format of the docs.
a 'make html' will produce the html version (using tex4ht).
a 'make ps' will produce PostScript documents.
a 'make pdf' will produce PDF (Portable Document Format) documents.
a 'make txt' will produce plain text documents.

If you only want the html reference documentation, type

make rtl.chk
make fcl.chk

The reference documentation and the list of compiler messages are 
created from the FPC sources. For this to work correctly, the 
documentation should be in the same directory as the rest of the 
FPC source tree.

Meaning a directory layout as

/FPC/compiler
    /rtl
    /packages
    /docs

or, alternatively, the directory structure as created when checking out
the build SVN-repository:

/FPC/fpcsrc/compiler
           /rtl
           /packages
         
   /fpcdocs

If you have the sources in another location, you can specify their
location through the FPCSRCDIR makefile variable, e.g like in:

make html FPCSRCDIR=/path/to/fpc/sources

If you want to produce dos docs, you can do a 'make htm' this will convert
the .html files to .htm files (including all references), suitable for a 8:3
format.

The rest of this document is only interesting if you want to write docs.
Otherwise, you can bail out now.

THE DOCS...

Why LaTeX ? 
- because I like a printed copy of the manuals, HTML just isn't good enough 
  for this.
- I know LaTeX very well :) (mind you : html also !)
- It converts to many other formats.
- many other reasons.

In order to translate the user manuals to HTML, I use tex4ht.

Why fpdoc ?
- Because it always creates up-to-date documentation.
- The documentation is separate from the units contrary to many other
  documentation tools which require comments in the sources, which makes
  the source unreadable.
- It's written in FPC.



Then how to proceed ?
If you just want to write general latex docs, just use fpc.sty. 
fpc.sty.doc describes what fpc.sty does. (one day I'll integrate them using
the doc package, but I need some time for it)

If you want to document units, use fpdoc. It is documented fairly complete,
and you can have a look at the many .xml units for examples on how to use
it.
